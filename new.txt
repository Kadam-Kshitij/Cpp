Malloc vs new
1) new calls the constructor, malloc does not
2) new is an operator, malloc is a function
3) new returns pointer of data type, malloc returns void pointer
4) new can be overloaded, malloc cannot
5) new calculates memory on its own, malloc needs the memory from user
6) In case of insufficient memory, malloc returns NULL, new throws bad_alloc exception.

delete vs free()
1) delete calls the destructor, free() does not.
2) delete is a operator, free() is a function
3) delete is faster than free()

delete NULL pointer has no effect

new will throw bad_alloc exception if it is not able to allocate memory.
But we can use
new( std::nothrow ) int;
In this case new will return NULL instread of exception.

void operator delete( void* )
void operator delete[]( void* )

If we use new with free(), then destructor is not called. This might cause memory leak.

-- Order of call --
Overloaded new operator
Constructor
Destructor
Overloaded delete operator
