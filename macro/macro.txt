============ Pre-processors ============
Expanded/Evaluated during pre-processing step.

#define
The defined quantity remains from the point it is declared till the end of file since pre-processor does not know anything about C++ concepts.

1) Object like macros with and without substitution text
  #define PARA
  #define PARA 12
2) Function like macros
  #define PRINT(x,y) ( std::cout << x << " " << y << std::endl )
  #define MIN(i,j) ( i < j ? i :j )
  #define PNT(k) ( (std::cout << k << std::endl), (std::cout << k+2 << std::endl))
  #define KK(x,y) ( std::cout << MIN(x, y) << std::endl )

#define x 5+2 		// Ok. Since preprocessor just replaces the contents

#if, #endif, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else
#if - checks if defined and value is not zero
#ifdef - only checks if defined. Value is not checked

#if 0, #if 1  // To prevent part of the code from compiling and not compiling

Eg -
#if defined( var )
#if !defined( var )
#if DLEVEL > 5
#if DLEVEL == 0

#pragma
This directive is a special purpose directive and is used to turn on or off some features. This type of directives are compiler-specific 
i.e., they vary from compiler to compiler.
#pragma startup foo1  // function needs to be called before main
#pragma exit foo2     // function needs to be called after main
#pragma ones          // include header file only ones like header guard

Define can also be done at time of compilation by provideing -DVAR or -DVAR=value. In case of -DVAR default value taken is 1.
