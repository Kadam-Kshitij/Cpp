--- Uses ---
1) Check for memory leaks ( not freeing dynamically allocated memory )
2) Finding invalid pointers ( accessing memory which was deleted/free )
3) Mismached new/malloc with delete/delete[]/free
4) Read or write to invalid memory location ( out of index memory )
5) Detecting use of uninitialized variables
6) Calling free() twice on the same pointer.
7) Allocating negative values of memory.
8) Overlapping memory copy operations.

--- Drawbacks ---
1) Will consume more memory than usual. This might be a problem in case we are testing a very huge program.
