============ this pointer ============
this pointer points to the object which called the class member variable.
It is of the same type as the object it is pointing to and is const. ( Base* const )

If we print
&obj in main or
this in class member function, it will print the same address which is the address of the class object.

It is sent internally by the compiler as an argument to the class member function.

this pointer is not availabe inside the static members since, static members are not associated to the object but to the class.

this pointer is available inside the constructor as well. The object is created and then

It is a rvalue, not a lvalue. So we cannot print its address like &this
or change its pointing location as this = new Base;

this is not available inside friend function

--- Use ---
Differentiate between member variable and function argument which have the same name.
this->x = x;
