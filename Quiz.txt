--- Prevent copy from object to another ---
Make the copy constructor and copy assignment operator private.

--- Prevent creating object on heap ---
Make new operator private
void* operator new( size_t size );

--- Initializer list is faster ---
Initializer list is one step operation. Initialize at the time of declaration ( copy constructor ).
Assigning inside the body of a constructor is two step. Define then assign ( using assignment operator ).
