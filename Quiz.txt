--- Prevent copy from object to another ---
Make the copy constructor and copy assignment operator private.

--- Prevent creating object on heap ---
Make new operator private
void* operator new( size_t size );

--- Initializer list is faster ---
Initializer list is one step operation. Initialize at the time of declaration ( copy constructor ).
Assigning inside the body of a constructor is two step. Define then assign ( using assignment operator ).

--- Nested class ---
Nested class privated members are not available in outside Enclosing class
Enclosing class private members have access to nested class members.

--- Reference to r-value ---
int&& ref = 5;
int&& ref = a; // CTE
&& is used for reference to r-value.
void foo( int&& z )
foo(23);
foo(a); // CTE

--- Reference address ---
We cannot print address of a reference
&a and &ref will print address of a.

--- Operator overload ---
<< and >> operators cannot be overloaded as member functions since it nneds to be done as a member function of left operand which is cout or cin.
=, [], (), -> needs to be overloaded as member function.
