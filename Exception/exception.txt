If Base catch block is present before derived catch block,
the derived catch block is never reached. Base catch block will catch both throw base ans throw derived

If Derived block is placed above base catch block
then base will catch throw base ans derived will catch throw derived

int catch block will not catch throw char.
Conversion does not take place in case of catch block.

catch( ... ) catches all types of exception

If exception is not caught, then program terminates

If constructor of a class throws exception then the destructor is not called since destructor is called only for fully created class objects

Destructor throws exception, then the program will terminate since there is no block to catch the exception

Exceptions should be thrown by value and caught by reference
This is to prevent object slicing
If we do throw; the original exception is rethrown.
If we do throw e; then the caught exception is rethrown
