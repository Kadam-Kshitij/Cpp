1) Reference cannot be void/NULL. POinters can be NULL.
2) Reference cannot refer to a different location other than the one it is initialized.
3) Reference needs to be initialized at the time of declaration.

Advantage of reference -
1) Since initializtion is must, wild reference do not exist.
2) Do not need dereferenc to access the value.


--- Reference ---
int& ref = a;
int& ref2 = b;
ref = b;    // This will change the value of a and ref. It will not make ref point to b
ref = ref2; // Same

const int& ref = a;
ref = 3;  // CTE
a = 18;   // This is OK

int& const z = a; // CTE - reference cannot have such a const
