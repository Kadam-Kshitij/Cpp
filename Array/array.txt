===== Size =====
1) sizeof( arr ) / sizeof( arr[0] )
2) std::size( arr ); // For C++17 and above

===== Index =====
Out of bound ( also negative ) indexing is allowed in arrays.
So one needs to be carefull since no errors are thrown and can cause some other variables value to be changed.

===== Passing to a function =====
An array gets converted to a pointer when passed to a function.
As a result the actual array gets passed. Making changes in the function causes actual array to change.

In the function, arr will act as a pointer. So sizeof will not give us proper output.
In function, sizeof( arr ) will display 8 which is sizeof pointer on 64-bit machine.

We need to pass an int parameter to the function along with the array. foo( arr, sizeof( arr ) / sizeof( arr[0] ) );
We can also write the foo function as void foo( int* ptr ) since array boils down to pointer when passed to a function.

===== Array and pointers =====
std::cout << arr << std::endl; prints the address of the first array element.
&arr[4] is actually &( *( arr + 4 ) ); which is arr + 4; which prints address of the 5th element of the array.
arr[4] is actually *( arr + 4 ); which prints the 5th element of the array.


===== For  =====
for( int i : arr ) in this i will iterate over the array. We need to use std::cout << i << std::endl; and not arr[i].
for( int& i : arr ) in this case if we change value of i, then the actual array element gets modified.

Since c++20, we can use a variable to keep a track of the index.
for( int i; int& val : arr ) which needs to be incremented in the loop every time ( ++i ).
