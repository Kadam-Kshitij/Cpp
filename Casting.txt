============ Const cast ============
Used to remove constantness of a pointer, reference, pointer to data-member when passing to a 3rd party function which does not use const
void print( int* x )
{
	std::cout << *x << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
	const int* a = new int( 12 );
	print( const_cast< int* >( a ) );
}


============ Dynamic cast ============
Used to find the appropriate down cast to derived class from base class.
Atleast one virtual function is needed to make this work. Causes CTE.
Performance overhead at run time.
Use static_cast if we are sure we will not cast to wrong type.
