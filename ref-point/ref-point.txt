1) Reference cannot be void/NULL. POinters can be NULL.
2) Reference cannot refer to a different location other than the one it is initialized.
3) Reference needs to be initialized at the time of declaration.

Advantage of reference -
1) Since initializtion is must, wild reference do not exist.
2) Do not need dereferenc to access the value.
