static members are only declared inside the class.
They need to be explicitly defined outside the class.

Class cannot contain data member as its own type
class A{
    A a;
};
This will give CTE - incomplete type
But it can contain static A a or A* a;


Need to define the static member outside the class as int Class::var;
Static members functions can only access static data members.
Static members/functions are not associated to the object but are associated to the class.
So we can access them directly without object as : Class::foo( 23 ); or Class::var = 34;
Static members should not be defined in header file. Causes linker problem due to multiple copies if the header file is included by multiple .cpp files.
This pointer is not available inside static member functions
Does not contribute to object size.
const cannot be used with static member functions ( CTE : static int foo() const )
Non static member functions can access static member functions via object.
Object can access static member function.
static member functions cannot be virtual.
