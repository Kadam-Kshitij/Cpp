========== Prevent dynamic object creation ==========
Make the new operator private

========== Prevent static object creation ==========
1) Use final keyword
2) Make constructor private. Create a static function which returns an instance of the class.
3) Create a dummy class with private constructor. virtually inherit the class from this class.

========== Overload new and delete operator ==========
void* operator new( size_t size )
{
}

void operator delete( void* ptr )
{
}
